# Sven Launcher - For Rod

This is to launch Svends.exe through the batch.sat file. The Sven Co-op Server will be put up for local use.

Only rod#0581 has access to majority of these commands

startsven - Launches Svends

restartsven - Kills Svends then re-launches Svends

stopsven - Kills Svends so it'll stop running while I'm not on my PC (the bot is still hosted off my PC unfortunately)

Alternatively, if 2 users (that are not rod#0581) do stopsven, it will also kill Svends
