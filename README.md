Lost Ark?

# Lost Ark?

Maintenance post was the plan but... Lost Ark has no api but I was considering just looking at twitter
for a maintenance post then just reposting the twitter post into discord.

# PUG

join - Places user into the queue and issues 'in queue...' role

queue - Check the queue list

quit - Removes user from the queue and removes 'in queue...' role

If teams have been assigned then this will notify users with 'PUG Leader' role to remove them.

team1 - Check Team 1 players

team2 - Check Team 2 players

Below requires 'PUG Leader' role

start - Begin matchmaking.

vc - Forces all players into their respective voice channels

add [user]- Force a user to enter the queue

ring [user] [team] - Force a user to join a team

remove [user] - Removes user from queue and team

clearall - Clears queue, team 1, and team 2

clearteams - Clears team 1 and team 2

clearqueue - Clears queue

cleanup - Removes the roles established from this bot from EVERY discord member

***WARNING*** This can take a long time

check - Mostly for debugging purposes but will send the message containing all cached info

# Plans

-Add a shuffle feature to pug_cog that will shuffle the teams around

-Add an options to redefine the roles and teams to meet the end user's needs

-Add an option to randomize a game to play

More error codes? Not sure yet.

Databasing! Would be neat to have a database to store data such as wins and losses. However, am poor.

I'm sure there's more that I am missing and this will be updated a few more times.

# Tune up or remake the music_cog

Not sure about this one as I originally intended to focus on my personal needs within my circle
and there are better alternatives that are well established already out there
